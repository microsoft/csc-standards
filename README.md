# Project

Great product teams don't just happen; they require commitment and work.  They are the outcome of continuous effort and deep desire to improve.  

Imagine a rowing team that has just been assembled.  While each team member has rowing experience, they don't become a team until they resolve who will do which roles and learn how to work together.  This repository contains the internally developed standards that our team will use to ensure we work together toward well understood goals.  This collection is not perfect, and may not even be good, but we will strive to learn and grow as a team and adapt these standards together.
